<h1>History of Dakshina Kannada</h1>
<p>Dakshina Kannada district is a district of Karnataka state in India, with
its headquarters in the coastal city of Mangalore. It is part of the larger Tulu
Nadu region. The district covers an area nestled in between the Western Ghats
to its east and the Arabian Sea to its west. Dakshina Kannada receives
abundant rainfall during the Indian monsoon. It is bordered by Udupi district
(formerly a part of this district) to the north, Chikmagalur district to the
northeast, Hassan district to the east, Kodagu to the southeast and Kasaragod
district of Kerala to the south. According to the 2011 census of India, Dakshina
Kannada district had a population of 2,083,625. It is the only district in
Karnataka state to have all modes of transport like road, rail, water and air due
to the presence of a major hub, Mangalore. This financial district is also known
as the Cradle of Indian banking.</p>

<p>The district geography consists of seashore in the west and Western Ghats
in the east. The soil is mostly lateritic type, characterised by high iron and
aluminium content.The major rivers are Netravathi, Kumaradhara, Gurupura
(Phalguni), Shambhavi, Nandini or Pavanje and Payaswini; all join the Arabian
sea. At Uppinangadi, the Netravathi and Kumaradhara rivers rise during the

monsoon and meet. This event is called "Sangam", which in Sanskrit means
confluence. Near Mangalore, an estuary is formed by the union of the rivers
Netravathi and the Gurupura which merge into the Arabian Sea.The
topography of the district is plain up to 30 km (18.64 mi) inside the coast and
changes to undulating hilly terrain sharply towards the east in the Western
Ghats. Teak, bamboo and rosewood trees are found in the hilly areas towards
the east. The Geological Survey of India has identified this district as a
moderately earthquake-prone region and categorised it in the Seismic III Zone.
In rural Dakshina Kannada, houses are in the midst of a farm field or
plantations of coconut or arecanut, separated by a few hundred
metres.Shirlalu village (in the Kudremukh range of Belthangady taluk), with a
maximum elevation of 1,115 m (3,658 ft), is the highest point in Dakshina
Kannada.</p>
