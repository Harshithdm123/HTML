<h1>YAKSHAGANA-- A Strong Cultural Bond of Tulunadu</h1>
<div id="embedded-box">
<p>Know about the amazing Cultural form of Dakshina Kannada.</p>
</div>
<p>Yakshagana is a traditional theatre, developed in Dakshina Kannada,
Udupi, Uttara Kannada, Shimoga and western parts of Chikmagalur districts,
in the state of Karnataka and in Kasaragod district in Kerala that combines
dance, music, dialogue, costume, make-up, and stage techniques with a
unique style and form. It is believed to have evolved from pre-classical music
and theatre during the period of the Bhakti movement.It is sometimes simply
called "Aata" or āṭ a (meaning "the play"). This theatre style is mainly found in
coastal regions of Karnataka in various forms. Towards the south from
Dakshina Kannada to Kasaragod of Tulu Nadu region, the form of Yakshagana
is called Thenku thittu and towards the north from Udupi up to Uttara
Kannada it is called Badaga thittu. Both of these forms are equally played all

over the region.(Not sure about this one but) Yakshagana is traditionally
presented from dusk to dawn. Its stories are drawn from Ramayana,
Mahabharata, Bhagavata and other epics from both Hindu and Jain and other
ancient Indic traditions.</p>
<p>Yakshagana literally means the people (gana) who are the yaksha (nature
spirits).Yakshagana is the scholastic name in Kannada (used for the last 200
years) for art forms formerly known as kēḷ ike, āṭ a, bayalāṭ a, and daśāvatāra.
The word Yakshagana previously referred to a form of literature primarily in
Kannada (starting from the 16th century). Of late Yakshaganas in Tulu and
even now in Telugu are available. Performance of this Yakshagana literature or
the play is called āṭ a. It is now no longer believed that the word Ekkalagaana
refers to Yakshagana.Yakshagana has a separate tradition of music, separate
from Karnataka Sangeetha and the Hindustani music of India. Yakshagana
and Karnatak Sangeetha may have a common ancestor are not decedents of
one another.</p>
<p>A typical Yakshagana performance consists of background music played
by a group of musicians (known as a himmela); and a dance and dialogue
group (known as the mummela), who together enact poetic epics on stage. The
himmela is made up of a lead singer (bhagawatha)—who also directs the
production—and is referred to as the "first actor" (modalane vesha). Additional
himmela members are players of traditional musical instruments, such as the
maddale (hand drum), the pungi (pipe), the harmonium (organ), and the
chande (loud drums). The music is based on ragas, which are characterised by
rhythmic patterns called mattu and tala (or musical meter in Western
music).</p>
