<p>The Kia Sportage is a lineup of sport utility vehicles manufactured by the South
Korean manufacturer Kia since 1993 through five generations. Initially a compact SUV
built on a body-on-frame chassis, the second-generation Sportage transitioned to a car-
based platform which placed it into the compact crossover SUV class, and has been
developed alongside the Hyundai Tucson. Since the fifth-generation model launched in
2021, Kia developed the Sportage in two sizes with different wheelbase lengths for
different markets.</p>
